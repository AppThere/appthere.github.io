Introducing Nuirs, the modern GUI toolkit for Rust. Build truly native, cross-platform applications with a focus on performance, safety, and an ergonomic developer experience.

## Nuirs empowers you to:

* **Develop once, deploy everywhere:** Target iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single codebase, achieving maximum code reuse. 
* **Write declarative, elegant UI code in Rust.** Describe your desired UI structure using Nuirs' composable `View` trait and a powerful modifier system.
* **Leverage native power.** Nuirs utilizes the underlying native platform widgets, ensuring your applications have optimal look-and-feel, performance, and accessibility on each platform.
* **Enjoy the speed and safety of Rust.** Build high-performance, reliable UIs with the confidence that Rust's robust type system helps catch errors early. 
* **Unlock advanced layout and graphics.** Leverage [Taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy) for flexible layout options, and utilize [Skia](https://skia.org/) via `rust-skia` for advanced 2D drawing capabilities.
