+++

We're thrilled to officially announce the launch of AppThere, our new GitHub organization! Born from the idea that software should be accessible and performant everywhere, AppThere is dedicated to the challenge of engineering truly ubiquitous applications.

Alongside the organization, we're launching our website – your central hub for learning about our projects and philosophy. This marks the beginning of our journey, and in this post, we want to dive into the core principles that drive us: our engineering philosophy focused on wide compatibility and efficiency, and how our own website embodies the commitment to speed and accessibility. Read on to learn more about our vision for AppThere.

## Philosophy

Our focus is on the engineering challenge of creating truly ubiquitous software.

### Broad Device Spectrum

We target a wide array of hardware endpoints, from traditional desktops (Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile devices (Android, iOS) to tablets, VR/AR headsets, and dedicated e-Note platforms. Our architecture anticipates diverse input methods and display capabilities.

### Core Principle: Portability

Cross-platform support is fundamental. We leverage technologies and design patterns that maximize code reuse and minimize platform-specific dependencies, ensuring a consistent core experience across all major operating systems.

### Performance as a Feature

We actively combat software bloat by prioritizing efficient algorithms, minimal resource consumption, and optimized performance. This commitment ensures AppThere applications run effectively on a broad range of hardware, including legacy systems and low-power devices.

### Our Goal

To develop and share applications that embody wide compatibility and efficient performance. Browse our repositories to learn more about our technical approaches and ongoing projects.

## A Website Built for Speed and Accessibility

Just like the software we create, the AppThere website is designed with performance and broad compatibility at its core. We believe accessing information about our projects should be fast, efficient, and work seamlessly, no matter your device or network speed.

### Fast by Design

This site is built using a static site generator. Instead of complex server processing for every visit, pages are pre-built and ready to go. This drastically reduces loading times and means the site feels snappy and responsive.

### Lean and Efficient

We've intentionally kept the underlying structure and styling simple. This results in lean pages that require less data to download, making the site quicker to load, especially on mobile networks or slower internet connections.

### Optimized Delivery

Taking cues from performance-focused approaches like the AMP project, we've optimized how the site's styling (CSS) is delivered. It's compact and embedded directly in the head of each page. This minimizes the number of requests your browser needs to make, allowing the content to appear faster.

### Clear on Any Screen

Our clean design and limited color palette aren't just for looks – they ensure the website remains clear and readable across a wide range of displays, including E Ink screens common on e-note devices.

The result is a web experience that respects your time and resources, loading quickly and displaying properly whether you're on a high-end desktop or a simple mobile device with limited connectivity.

## Looking Forward

This launch marks just the beginning for AppThere. Our commitment, as outlined above, is to consistently engineer software that embodies efficiency and true cross-platform compatibility. We believe this approach, reflected even in the performance-first design of this website, is crucial for creating accessible and user-respecting digital tools.

We invite you to explore our repositories on GitHub, follow the AppThere organization for updates, and see these principles in action. Whether you're looking for lightweight applications or are interested in contributing to the vision, we're excited to build this community. Welcome aboard – we can't wait to show you what's next!
